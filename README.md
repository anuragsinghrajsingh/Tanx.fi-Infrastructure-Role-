## Online Store Order Analysis

### Overview

This project analyzes customer order data from an online store to gain insights into revenue, product performance, and customer behavior. 
The analysis includes:

Monthly revenue calculation,
Revenue per product,
Revenue per customer,
Identification of top 10 customers by revenue.

There are 2 juypter notebook files one with little explanation(done with only inbuilt functions and methods) and the other with full explanation(done with both inbuilt functions and methods as well as manual method with little inbuilt functions and methods).
Because of limited time, one is done earlier and the other is done later.

### Technologies Used

Python (for overall coding and result)
Pandas (for data manipulation)
seaborn and matplotlib (Data Visualization)

### Dataset

orders.csv: Contains order details with columns:
order_id	
quantity	
product_id	
price
seller_id	
freight_value	
customer_id	
order_status	
purchase_date	
payment_type	
product_category_name	
product_weight_gram

### Method Used
1) Inbuilt method and function used to calculate the desired result.
2) Manual method with the little inbuilt function and method used to calculate the desired result.

All the lines of the code are written with proper explanation. (little knowledge is required to understand the concept written and explained)
Both inbuilt and manual methods are separated properly.

### Usage
